Sit-On-Chair is my first full web page done during front-end bootcamp at Coders Lab.
This web page was set to be (and is) not repsonsive. 
There are few functionalities (sliding submenu, charis slider, disappearing images, price calculator) which are made using jquery.
Hope you'll enjoy exploring the page!
